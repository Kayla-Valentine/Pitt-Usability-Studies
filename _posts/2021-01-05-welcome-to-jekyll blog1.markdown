##Thanks for joining our class. 

I hope we can develop this blog space to best represent the learning we are doing in this course. We can share ideas, ask questions, learning from one another as we go along. These post are written in a language called Markdown. Unlike HTML, Markdown can be read by computers and processed into viewable text. It combines front matter (information that the compter uses to organize this post) and general content that you are reading right now. In truth, I am still learning about how all of this works and will need your help to improve our blog following best practices and a little usability testing.
