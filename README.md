Making Blog Contributions

Keep your writing short and snappy! And don't be afraid to play--blogs should informative, but also fun and entertaining. Be sure to add a visual or two. You can learn more in markdown docs. 

You can learn more about [Markdown](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and its creator John Gruber by clicking [HERE](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

## Get started!

1. Return to the main repository but keep this page handy. 

2. Open up the "post" directory on the repo. 

3. Open the file "2021-01-19-blog-template.markdown"

4. Click on the "raw" view on the right-hand side.

5. Copy the raw text. 

6. Open a new file in a Markdown reader like [MacDown] (https://github.com/MacDownApp) or [Dillinger] (https://dillinger.io) on your computer. 

7. Paste the raw code into the file and edit front matter and blog title/text to create your blog. 

8. When finished, return to the GitHub repository and open up the "post" directory.

9. Click on "Add file" on the right-hand side. In the drop-down select "Create new file."

10. Name the new file using the following format 2021-01-19-Name-Here.markdown

11. Copy your blog post text and paste it into this new file. 

12. When finished, scroll down and select "Propose new file." 

13. Now you will be sent to a "Compare changes" page. You will need to make a pull request that asks the repository owner to consider a change to the blog. Click "Create Pull Request." Leave the comment "YOUR NAME's new blog post" and click "Create pull request." 

14. The owner will now be alerted that you have suggested a change. Great Job! You're learning about writing in Markdown and working with others on GitHub. Thank you for your contributions.
